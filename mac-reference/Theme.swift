// panel, ink, stickies, rules, the flourish, the onboarding envelope.
//
// The five alternates were derived from the cream original in Figma: each holds
// the original's lightness and saturation exactly and rotates every hue into an
// 11° band anchored on its sticky-note colour. Only the temperature moves, so
// the value relationships the app leans on for hierarchy survive intact —
// panels still sit a shade under the sheet, hover states still resolve one step
// lighter, and ink on sheet stays past 4.5:1 in all six.
//
// Colours are held as NSColor because AppKit needs them (text storage, layout
// manager, sticky drawing) and SwiftUI can always borrow one via Color(nsColor:).
// That also means each value exists exactly once, rather than as a Color and an
// NSColor typed out separately and free to drift apart.

    // - `rule`, for the horizontal rules that are gone from the editor. The
    //   ruled page draws itself with `Style.ruleTone`, for the same reason.
    // - `flourishHover`, from the treatment where hovering *lifted* the corner
