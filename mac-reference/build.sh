# Everything that makes this a distinct app from the shipping JUI lives in these
# three lines, and nowhere else. The re-JUI branch is a look rebuild: it has to
# be installable and runnable *beside* the real app without touching its notes,
# its settings or its Dock tile, so it gets its own name, its own bundle id
# (hence its own UserDefaults domain and — via CFBundleName — its own vault),
# and its own build counter so the two branches never fight over one number.
#
# Merging this branch back into main means restoring these three values. That is
# the whole revert, which is why they are hoisted here rather than committed
# into Info.plist.

# There is no loop of individual PNGs here any more, and no PNGs at the repo
# root to feed one. The rebuild replaced every static mark with the stop-motion
# flourish below, so Flourish, StickyFlower, FolderSprig, OnboardingLogo,
# StickyFlourish and FolderFlourish were all still being copied into every
# bundle with nothing left in the app that drew them. The two remaining kinds of
# art ship as *directories* — Textures and FlourishFrames — which is also what
# stops this failing silently: a per-asset list does nothing when someone adds a
# file and forgets to name it, and on this branch drawing nothing and drawing a
# very subtle grain look identical.

# The icon is copied separately because this branch ships a different one. It
# still lands as AppIcon.icns, which is what CFBundleIconFile in Info.plist
# names — so the source plist stays describing the real app here too.

# The sources are 4096px colour PNGs at ~10MB each — 31MB against an app that
# was under 1MB. What ships is derived: downsampled, greyscale, JPEG.
#
# Greyscale because the textures are neutral by design and the colour channels
# carry nothing. JPEG because photographic grain is precisely what PNG is worst
# at, and because the loss it adds is far below the loss the downsample already
# costs — measured at 0.88 levels of error against 0.81 for lossless at the same
# size, on a surface multiplied at 50%. A fifth of the size for no visible
# difference.

# Cached on modification time: converting three 4096px photographs takes long
# enough to be irritating on every rebuild, and these change rarely.

      #
      # Everything else takes the whole photograph, downsampled, because it is

      # size, and dropping that into a 260pt panel puts a visible streak across

# Flourish animation: 30 frames of a stop-motion draw-on, split out of one
# animated SVG and rasterised here.
#
# The export stacks all 30 frames in a single file and reveals them in turn with
# CSS @keyframes on opacity. Nothing in AppKit runs that — no SMIL, no CSS
# animation, no clock — so rendering the file as it stands draws every frame at
# once. Each frame is lifted into its own document first, then drawn.
#
# Raster, unusually for this branch. The artwork is a single tone, so a template
# image tinted at draw time still follows the theme, which is the property that
# made vectors worth the trouble elsewhere. What vectors would cost here is
# reimplementing SVG mask semantics — the later frames are drawn by masking a
# full-bleed rect, so the mask carries the shape — and letting the renderer
# resolve that is exact rather than nearly right. 30 frames come to under 300KB.
#
# Cached on the source's modification time; splitting and rendering 30 frames is
# slow enough to notice on every build.

# --- stage a copy outside ~/Documents ----------------------------------------
# Run the staged copy, not the one that was just built here.
#
# This repo lives inside ~/Documents, which macOS protects with TCC, and the
# bundle's own resources — every texture and PNG — are therefore files in a
# protected folder. Launching the app reads them, so macOS asks permission.
#
# Normally that is a one-time question: macOS exempts an app for its own bundle
# and remembers the answer. Both depend on a stable code-signing identity, and
# an ad-hoc signature has none — `codesign --sign -` leaves Signature=adhoc with
# TeamIdentifier not set, and this script re-signs from scratch on every build,
# so the identity differs each time. The approval has nothing durable to attach
# to, and the prompt comes back on every single launch.
#
# Notarised distribution would fix it properly. Until then the cheap fix is to
# not run it from a protected folder: verified, the same bundle launched from
# here never asks. The zip and the bundle in the repo are untouched, so what
# ships is unchanged.
