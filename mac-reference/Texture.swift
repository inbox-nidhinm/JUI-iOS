// as *blend layers over themed colour*, never as pictures in their own right.
//
// They are measurably neutral: R = G = B on every sample, mean colour cast 0.00.
// That is the whole trick. The colour comes from the theme underneath and only
// the tone comes from the paper, so one file serves all six palettes instead of
// needing six. Tinting one on the way in would break that, and would break it
// invisibly — correct in cream, subtly muddy in the other five, with no single
// pixel you could point at.
//
// The same reasoning says a texture must never be drawn opaque. It is always a
// multiply at a fraction, so what you see is the theme's own colour with the
// paper's tone pressed into it.

    // flat colour no matter what opacity it is drawn at. The sticky looked
    // untextured for exactly that reason, and no opacity would have fixed it.
    //
